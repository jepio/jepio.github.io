I can't believe how awesome this is, it's the greatest thing to happen to me
since I got a laptop with a physical middle button which finally made separating
the CLIPBOARD-SELECTION buffer feasible. It's `xsel`!

    :::bash
    xsel -b < file.in
    xsel -b > file.out

and more, can be found in `man xsel`. It's awesome.
