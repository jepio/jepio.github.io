</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I'm not usually a hater against Windows but this time I feel it's time to
speak up. I wanted to install Windows 8 on my new laptop, but since it doesn't
have a CD/DVD drive (and I wouldn't want it) I wanted to load the ISO onto a USB
stick to install from. Now I didn't have a USB stick until last week when I went
to the store to buy one. As I was looking at the shelves in Saturn I was sure I
wanted a USB 3.0 pendrive with the greatest possible read/write speeds.</p>
<p>So I bought a Sandisk pendrive and was happy with my choice until today. That's
not to say I'm not, because it has everything I hoped for. The problem lies in
Windows. You see, it's not possible to install Windows from a USB 3.0 pendrive
since that requires drivers. And to load these drivers I would need a USB 2.0
stick. Aaaaargh!</p>
<p>I actually think this has something to do with licensing. Microsoft can't bundle
vendor USB 3.0 drivers and it doesn't want to (can't?) include the open source
ones. So here I am, stuck with a nice USB 3.0 pendrive with Windows 8 on it,
able to boot from it in UEFI mode but not being able to install because once the
boot process ends the installer doesn't have access to the drive.</p>
<p>Seems I'll have to borrow an older pendrive from someone. Oh well.</p>
