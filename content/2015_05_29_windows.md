Title: Windows... blows?

I'm not usually a hater against Windows but this time I feel it's time to
speak up. I wanted to install Windows 8 on my new laptop, but since it doesn't
have a CD/DVD drive (and I wouldn't want it) I wanted to load the ISO onto a USB
stick to install from. Now I didn't have a USB stick until last week when I went
to the store to buy one. As I was looking at the shelves in Saturn I was sure I
wanted a USB 3.0 pendrive with the greatest possible read/write speeds.

So I bought a Sandisk pendrive and was happy with my choice until today. That's
not to say I'm not, because it has everything I hoped for. The problem lies in
Windows. You see, it's not possible to install Windows from a USB 3.0 pendrive
since that requires drivers. And to load these drivers I would need a USB 2.0
stick. Aaaaargh!

I actually think this has something to do with licensing. Microsoft can't bundle
vendor USB 3.0 drivers and it doesn't want to (can't?) include the open source
ones. So here I am, stuck with a nice USB 3.0 pendrive with Windows 8 on it,
able to boot from it in UEFI mode but not being able to install because once the
boot process ends the installer doesn't have access to the drive.

Seems I'll have to borrow an older pendrive from someone. Oh well.
